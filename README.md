Here is a summery of my work during my summer internship at Chinese University of Hong Kong



- Weeks 1 & 2:

- I began by writing detailed reports on the Block LSM, Chain KV, and COLE papers. These reports are available in the repository under their respective names: 'BlockLSM.pdf', 'chainkv (1).pdf', and 'COLE.pdf'.

- Week 3:

-   I created a comparative analysis slide deck to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of Block LSM, Chain KV, and COLE. This comparison is documented in 'The Comparison of COLE, ChainKV and BlockLSM (1).pdf' and 'compare.pdf'.

- Weeks 4 & 5:

-   I focused on re-evaluating the COLE paper, revisiting its methodology and findings. My evaluation notes can be found in cole_evaluation_notes.pdf and the demo report.

- Weeks 6 & 7:

-   During these weeks, I conducted various experiments to analyze different parameters and performance metrics based on the COLE paper setup. The results are meticulously plotted and analyzed, with each plot accompanied by specific comments. These are included within the repository as '.py' files, such as 'fig11.py', 'fig13b.py', and others. Additionally, I have documented the relationship between various parameters in 'cole-plots, relation of scale and block height.pdf'.

- Week 8:

- Finally, I compiled all my findings and comparisons into the 'cole_final_report.pdf' and 'demoreportcole.pdf'. These documents encapsulate my entire journey, including a final comparison of results against the COLE paper.

To facilitate further experimentation, I have included the scripts used to test and run experiments, each designed to simulate workloads based on the COLE setup. These can be found under various names such as 'test_experiments.py' and run_experminets.py'
